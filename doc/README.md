# Watchdog hardware hack

The hardware hack is quite simple. One approach I did was this:

The Raspberry Pi is located behind a picture frame in a central position of the house.
From a distance it looks like a normal photograph.

But when you look closer, you can see the Raspberry Pi camera module looking at you.

All the required hardware stuff (Raspberry Pi, camera module, SD card and WLAN dongle) is mounted on the backside of the picture frame.
